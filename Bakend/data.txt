Gender Equality in Rwanda
Rwanda has made significant strides in promoting gender equality by ensuring that women occupy positions in sectors traditionally dominated by men. Women are now actively participating in education, politics, and various 
roles previously considered male-oriented. This inclusive approach recognizes that women do not only bear the responsibility of nurturing future generations but also play a vital role in the country's development.

Reporting Violence in Rwanda
In instances of violence, it is crucial to report to the nearest police station promptly. Timely reporting enables law enforcement to arrest offenders and follow through on cases effectively. Victims should provide comprehensive
 information to the police, regardless of the perpetrator's identity, including if they are a family member. The police in Rwanda are committed 
to assisting and protecting victims. For cases of domestic and/or gender-based violence, individuals can also call the emergency hotline at 116 and also you cal call Isange One Stop Center for Help on 3029 to get immediate support.

Gender Equality in Education and Empowerment
USAID ensures that girls are equally represented in educational programs, especially those focused on early-grade literacy in Rwanda. Gender equality is a core principle in training volunteers on topics such as child protection, safeguarding, and positive parenting. USAID believes that achieving gender equality and women’s empowerment is integral to development. The organization recognizes that factors such as water, energy, agriculture, conflict, and health impact men and women differently, presenting opportunities for more targeted, inclusive, and sustainable development.

Rwanda’s Achievements in Gender Representation
Rwanda is recognized as a leader in gender equality and women’s empowerment, with women occupying 61 percent of the seats in the Rwandan Parliament and 50 percent of the President’s cabinet. While these achievements are noteworthy, challenges persist, particularly regarding socio-economic equality and cultural change at the community level. To address these issues, USAID/Rwanda integrates gender equality and social inclusion into its strategies and activities. In the fiscal year 2022, USAID/Rwanda implemented 15 initiatives specifically targeting gender equality and female empowerment.

Reporting Violence for Children
Children who feel uncomfortable or threatened should immediately report the situation to the appropriate authorities, ensuring that the matter is handled by those qualified to intervene. Hiding such incidents can endanger their lives and the lives of other children in similar situations.
